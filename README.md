# Instance Stixels: Segmenting and Grouping Stixels into Objects

In this repository we will provide an implementation of the image segmentation pipeline presented in our paper "Instance Stixels: Segmenting and Grouping Stixels into Objects".
The paper was published at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles symposium 2019 (https://www.iv2019.org).
The code will be made available shortly after the conference.
